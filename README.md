## Report 📑
``report/Problema_de_Fluxo_maximo.pdf``

## Project 💻
##### Transform Maximum Flow problem to minimum flow cost problem
##### Solved it using python ortools linear-programming library

## How to run 🕊
##### Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/lucasmsa/po-ufpb.git`
##### Go to the root folder of the project `cd po-ufpb`
##### Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
##### Run with some instance inside the folder `input/instancias` or add more instances that follow the same pattern and add them to that folder. For any `.txt` file inside the folder run:
##### `python src/maximum_flow.py <instance_name_without_.txt>`
##### Results will be available at the `output` folder on `maximum_flow_results.pdf` with the flow that passed through each edge, as well as the optimal solution and the generated graph for the problem solution
